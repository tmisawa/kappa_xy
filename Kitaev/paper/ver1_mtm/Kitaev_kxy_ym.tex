\section{Introduction}
%Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) is a highly correlated state of quantum spins 
%without having any long-range orders. 
%Among a variety of QSLs, Kitaev \orange{quantum} spin liquid (KSL) 
%realized as the ground state of the honeycomb lattice Kitaev model~\cite{Kitaev2006} 
%is one of the most studied QSLs in two-dimensional spin models  
%by both experiments and theories~(for a review, see Ref.[\onlinecite{Motome_JPSJ2020}]). 
%Kitaev spin liquid is a キタエフスピン液体は大事。興味をもたれているというこをを書いた方がよい。保留。

\red{[we may break down the following paragraph into a general introduction of fractionalization, quantum spin liquid, and Kitaev QSL; see for instance Kato-san's paper on spin Seebeck]}
Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) are enigmatic states of quantum spin \red{system}s,
which do not %show 
exhibit any 
spontaneous
symmetry breaking even at zero temperature.
Since the QSLs are the source of exotic emergent particles,
such as Majorana %particles (
\red{fermions and} anyon\red{s%)
,} the search for QSLs has been 
one of the central issues of modern condensed matter physics.
Among %several 
various types of QSLs, the Kitaev QSL~\cite{Kitaev2006}, which appears as the ground state
of the Kitaev model on a %the
honeycomb lattice, 
has attracted %a great deal of attention 
significant interest 
%because
sinc\red{e %it has been rigorously 
%shown that 
i}ts low-energy excitations can be \red{rigorously} described by
noninteracting Majorana fermions.
%\blue{noninteracting} Majorana particles appear in low-energy degrees of freedom.
However, it %has been a challenging problem how
remains a challenge to detect the Majorana fermions
in \red{candidate materials for} the Kitaev QSL, since the Majorana fermions are charge-neutral and do not show any characteristic behaviors 
%as a 
in response to electric or magnetic fields.

The thermal Hall conductivity is a promising observable for detecting the
emergent Majorana fermions as they carry heat~\cite{Kitaev2006}.
In the Kitaev model, perturbatively-introduced magnetic fields make the Majorana fermion %systems (systemsはいらない？)
\red{bands} topologically nontrivial.
Accordingly, a
chiral edge current appears, which is protected by %the 
\red{the band topology characterized with} a nonzero Chern number \red{$\nu$}.
Because the chiral edge current is an energy current of Majorana fermions, 
the thermal Hall conductivity %takes 
\red{$\kappa_{xy}$ divided by temperature $T$ is quantized as} %exhibits the half-quantized value 
\begin{align}
{\frac{\kappa_{xy}}{T} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\pi k_{\mathrm{B}}^2}{6\hbar}}\red{\nu,}
\label{eq:k_xy}
\end{align}
in the zero temperature limit\red{, where $k_{\mathrm{B}}$ and $\hbar$ denote the Boltamann and Dirac constants, respectively}.
\red{Here, $\nu$ takes $\pm 1$ depending on the direction of the magnetic field. This quantized value is half of that for electrons with the same band topology, and hence, it is called the half-integer quantization.} 
%This half-quantization 
\red{Detecting this peculiar behavior} offers
direct evidence of the 
Majorana fermions.

%The thermal Hall conductivity is one of the characteristic phenomena observed 
%in the \orange{KSL} under applied magnetic field~\cite{Kitaev2006}. 
%Based on the Majorana fermions picture, the external magnetic field opens a gap in the bands of %mobile 
%\orange{itinerant} Majorana fermions, 
%and the chiral edge current appears. 
%Due to the chiral edge current, the thermal Hall transport is induced. 
%Because the chiral edge current is a current of \orange{Majorana} fermions, 
%the thermal Hall conductivity takes the half-quantized value 
%\begin{align}
%\orange{\frac{\kappa_{xy}}{T} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\pi k_{\mathrm{B}}^2}{6\hbar}}
%\end{align}
%in the zero temperature limit.

%Recently, a thermal Hall experiment for $\alpha$-$\mathrm{RuCl_3}$ 
%reported that the half-quantization of the thermal Hall conductivity occurs
%under a tilted magnetic field~\cite{Kasahara_Nature2018}.
%Recently
\red{Strikingly}, \red{such a half-integer quantization was reported in the} %a 
thermal Hall experiment for \red{a quasi-two-dimensional van der Waals magnet} $\alpha$-$\mathrm{RuCl_3}$ 
%has reported the observation of half-\red{integer} quantization

Although $\alpha$-$\mathrm{RuCl_3}$ shows magnetic zigzag order at zero magnetic field~{\cite{Sears_PRB2015,Williams_PRB2015,Cao_PRB2016}},

%An independent measurement of the thermal Hall conductivity has also %shows 
%reported the half-integer quantization of the thermal Hall conductivity
%~\cite{Bruin_NPhys2022}.

However, there remains controversy on interpreting the observed thermal Hall transport as %the 
evidence of the Kitaev QSL. 
For example, the observed thermal Hall conductivity %shows 
\red{exhibits} an overshoot\red{ing behavior while decreasing temperature before converging to} %of 
%beyond 
the half-\red{integer} quantized value\red{.} 
%for higher temperatures, 
%and t
\red{T}he origin of %such overshooting 
\red{this} behavior %has not been

although contributions from phonons~\cite{Ye2018Quantization,Vinkler2018} and visons~\cite{Joy2022} %have been 
\red{were} proposed. 
In addition, real compounds, including $\alpha$-$\mathrm{RuCl_3}$, %could 
\red{may} contain additional interactions \red{not included in the Kitaev model,} 
such as the Heisenberg interactio\red{n}%s
~\cite{Chaloupka_PRL2010,Chaloupka_PRL2013}, and the \red{symmetric} off-diagonal $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ interactions~\cite{Rau2014,Rau2014pre,Winter2016}\red{, whose} %.

Furthermore, several %later

in the limit of zero temperature 
and weak magnetic fields \red{as mentioned above~\cite{Kitaev2006}.} %, which %are introduced

%These calculations successfully showed a double-peak structure in the specific heat and its relationship %to

To investigate the thermal Hall conductivity %transport 
in \red{the} Kitaev \red{spin} systems,

 \mathcal{H}_{ij}^\gamma &= \Bigl[ K S_i^\gamma S_j^\gamma + \Gamma\left( S_i^\mu S_j^\nu + S_i^\nu S_j^\mu \right) \notag\\

\red{A microscopic origin of the Kitaev interaction $K$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:model-Hamiltonian} was proposed for effective $j_{\rm eff}=1/2$ moments in spin-orbit coupled Mott insulating systems~\cite{Jackeli_PRL2009}. 
It was pointed out that magnetic ions with $t_{2g}^5$ electron configurations comprise the spin-orbit entangled $j_{\rm eff}=1/2$ states under the strong spin-orbit coupling, and exchange processes with indirect hoppings via ligands generate the bond-dependent Kitaev-type interactions between the $j_{\rm eff}=1/2$ moments in edge-sharing octahedral coordinates.}

%They are derived by performing perturbation expansions in the strong correlation limit of the three-orbital Hubbard model for the $t_{2g}^5$ configuration~\cite{Jackeli_PRL2009}.
%The virtual hoppings via $p$ orbitals in ligand ions %mainly dominate 
%primarily govern the exchange process, and direct hoppings between the neighboring $d$ orbitals are secondary.
%The former induces the Kitaev and $\Gamma$ interactions, but the Heisenberg interaction is caused only by the latter. Hence, the Kitaev and $\Gamma$ interactions are %believed to be leading interactions for

\subsection{Thermal Hall conductivity}\label{subsec:Thermal Hall conductivity}
%{\bf \orange{このkappaxyの定義に関して引用文献は必要？}}\blue{[$\to$追加してみました]}
To investigate the thermal Hall conductivity in %the 
Kitaev systems, w\red{e %first 
d}efine 
%the energy current $\bm{J}_{\mathrm{E}}$ through the commutation relation between the Hamiltonian and 
the energy polarization %$\bm{P}_{\mathrm{E}}$, which %are
%is defined %as
%by
\red{as}~\cite{Katsura2010,NasuYM2017}
%$\bm{P}_{\mathrm{E}}$, as $\bm{J}_{\mathrm{E}} =  i \left[\mathcal{H}, \bm{P}_{\mathrm{E}}\right] \notag$
%\blue{, where the reduced Planck constant is set to be unity [$k_B$を1にすることと長さの単位についても言及した方がよいかもしれません。]}\red{Modelのところの$K=-1$のところに単位などについて、まとめて書くことにした。$\hbar$はとりあえずここのまま。}. 
%$\hbar$はkbのところで1にすると宣言
%The energy polarization is defined as 
\begin{equation}
 \bm{P}_{\mathrm{E}} = \sum_{\alpha,\beta,\gamma}\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle_\gamma} \frac{\bm{r}_i + \bm{r}_j}{2} J_{\alpha\beta}^\gamma S_i^\alpha S_j^\beta - \sum_{i,\gamma} \bm{r}_i h^\gamma S_i^\gamma,
\end{equation}
where $\bm{r}_i$ is the position of site $i$. 
From the commutation relation between the Hamiltonian and $\bm{P}_{\mathrm{E}}$,
the energy current $\bm{J}_{\mathrm{E}}$ is 
%given by
\red{obtained as} 
%defined as
%By substituting $\bm{P}$ into the definition of $\bm{J}_{\mathrm{E}}$, we obtain
  \begin{align}
   \bm{J}_{\mathrm{E}} &=  i \left[\mathcal{H}, \bm{P}_{\mathrm{E}}\right] \notag \\
&= \sum_{\gamma,\gamma'}\sum_{\langle i,j,k\rangle_{\gamma,\gamma'}} \frac{\bm{r}_k-\bm{r}_i}{2}L_{ijk}^{\gamma\gamma'} + \sum_{\gamma}\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle_{\gamma}} \frac{\bm{r}_j-\bm{r}_i}{2}M_{ij}^{\gamma} 
   \label{eq:def_J},
  \end{align}
where $\langle i,j,k\rangle_{\gamma,\gamma'}$ represent\red{s} %the 
three neighboring sites consisting o\red{f %the 
t}wo nearest-neighbor pairs $\langle i,j\rangle_{\gamma}$ and $\langle j,k\rangle_{\gamma'}$ connected at site $j$.
The operator $L_{ijk}^{\gamma\gamma'}$ is the contribution from three-spin correlations,
\begin{equation}
 L_{ijk}^{\gamma\gamma'} = \sum_{\alpha,\beta,\alpha',\beta',\gamma''} J_{\alpha\beta}^\gamma J_{\alpha'\beta'}^{\gamma'} \epsilon_{\alpha\gamma''\alpha'} S_i^\beta S_j^{\gamma''}S_k^{\beta'},
 \label{eq:L}
\end{equation}
and $M_{ij}^\gamma$ represents the contribution from two-spin correlations,
\begin{equation}
 M_{ij}^{\gamma} = \sum_{\alpha,\beta,\gamma',\gamma''} J_{\alpha\beta}^\gamma h_{\gamma'} \epsilon_{\gamma'\alpha\gamma''} \left(S_i^{\gamma''} S_j^{\beta} - S_i^{\beta} S_j^{\gamma''} \right),
 \label{eq:M}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$ %means 
denotes the completely antisymmetric tensor, which comes from the commutation relation between spins. 
\red{The schematic pictures of these operators are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lattice}(b).} 
It is worth noting that \red{the} three\red{-spin} produc\red{t %of spin operators 
i}n $L_{ijk}^{\gamma\gamma'}$ coincides with the effective \red{magnetic} field derived by third-order perturbations with respect to $\bm{h}$ \red{in the Majorana representation of the Kitaev model~\cite{Kitaev2006,NasuYM2017}}.
%In the Majorana representation, t
\red{T}he effective \red{magnetic} field %gives

\red{topology} with nonzero Chern numbers~\cite{Kitaev2006}.
Thus, \red{the $L_{ijk}^{\gamma\gamma'}$ term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_J} is expected to induce a} %the 
chiral edge curren\red{t %originating from $L_{ijk}^{\gamma\gamma'}$ is expected to %appear

\red{In contrast, the $M_{ij}^{\gamma}$ term is proportional to the magnetic field, which is not present in the perturbation. 
These two contributions will be examined separately in Sec.~\ref{sec:Results}.}

We note that our definition of the energy current is 
different from that used in Ref.~[\onlinecite{KumarT2023}], where the energy current is defined %by 
through the commutation relation %between

\subsection{Tensor network method}\label{subsec:Tensor network method}
%In this section, we explain 
\red{Let us first introduce} the tensor network method %used 
employed in our study. 
%for larger clusters that cannot be treated by the thermal pure quantum state method. 
To calculat\red{e %the 
f}inite-temperature properties of the model \red{given by Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$}, 
we approximate %a 
the density matrix of the system at an inverse temperature $\beta$, $\rho(\beta) = e^{-\beta\mathcal{H}}$, %as 
by a matrix product operator (MPO) with %the 
bond dimension $D$ [%S
\red{s}ee Fig.~\ref{fig:XTRG}(a)]. \red{In the actual calculations, %T
t}he string of the MPO is arranged in a snake form \red{on the honeycomb cluster}, %as shown in
as indicated by the gray line in Fig.~\ref{fig:lattice}(a). 

To optimize the tensors in an MPO as the density matrix at $\beta$, 
we employ the %exponential thermal tensor renormalization group (
\red{XTRG} %) 
approach~\red{\cite{Chen2018%,Li2020
}}, which has been successfully used to calculate %calculated 
finite temperature properties of %the 
\red{extended} Kitaev model\red{s~\cite{Li2020, LiZWWGQLGL2021}}. In the XTRG method, 
we calculate the density matrix at $\beta$ through the relationship
\begin{equation}
 \rho(\beta)=\rho(\beta/2)\rho(\beta/2).
\end{equation}
When $\rho(\beta/2)$ is represented by an MPO with the bond dimension $D$, $\rho(\beta)$ becomes an MPO with the bond dimension $D^2$. We approximate $\rho(\beta)$ by an MPO with bond dimension $D$ through the standard optimization procedure for the matrix product states (MPS) \cite{Chen2018}  [see Fig.~\ref{fig:XTRG}(b)]. In %particular
\red{the optimization}, we employ the two-site update, %and 
\red{resulting in} the %computation 
\red{total} computational cos\red{t %of the XTRG %algorithm 
%method 
s}cales as $O(D^4)$. As the initial condition of the XTRG %algorithm, 
method, we prepare $\rho(\beta_0)$ with $\beta_0 = 10^{-7}$ through the approximated form $\rho(\beta_0) \simeq 1 - \beta_0\mathcal{H}$, where the Hamiltonian is represented as an MPO. We calculate the expectation value of an operator ${O}$ through thus obtained $\rho(\beta)$ as $\langle {O} \rangle = \mathrm{Tr}%~
[{O}\rho] /\mathrm{Tr}%~
\rho$ (%N
\red{n}ote that the density matrix is not normalized). 
The temperature derivative of $\langle {O} \rangle$ is computed %through numerical derivative.
by numerical differentiation.
In the following, we mainly show the data with $D=500$ for \red{the} $(L, L') = (6, 6)$ %cylinder
\red{cluster}. Several benchmark calculations for different values of $D$ and %a 
different %lattice

\subsection{Thermal pure quantum state}\label{subsec:Thermal pure quantum state}
%In this section
\red{Next}, we %explain 
\red{describe} the %basics of the canonical 
%thermal quantum pure (
\red{cTPQ} %) 
state method~\cite{Sugiura_PRL2013}, 
which enables us to calculat\red{e %the 
f}inite\red{-}temperature properties of quantum many-body systems using the power method. We note that several similar methods were independently proposed~\cite{Imada_JPSJ1986,Jaklic_PRB1994,Hams_PRE2000,Lloyd} before the proposal of the cTPQ \red{state} method~[\onlinecite{Sugiura_PRL2013}].
%We construct t
\red{T}he 
cTPQ state %$|\Phi_{\rm cTPQ}^{p}\rangle$ 
\red{is constructed} a\red{s} %follows:
\begin{align}
|\Phi_{\rm cTPQ}^{p}(\beta)\rangle = \exp\Big[-\frac{\beta}{2}\mathcal{H}\Big]|\Phi_{\rm rand}^{p}\rangle,
\end{align}
wher\red{e} %$\beta$ is inverse temperature and 
$|\Phi_{\rm rand}^{p}\rangle$ is the $p$th initial random vector, which is uniformly distributed
on the $N_{\rm H}$\red{-}dimensional hypersphere ($N_{\rm H}$ is the dimension of the Hilbert space of the given system).
Any local physical quantity at inverse temperature $\beta$
can be calculated as the expectation values of $|\Phi_{\rm cTPQ}^{p}(\beta)\rangle$, i.e.,
\begin{align}
\langle A(\beta)\rangle
=\frac{\langle \Phi_{\rm cTPQ}^{p}(\beta)|A|\Phi_{\rm cTPQ}^{p}(\beta)\rangle}
{\langle \Phi_{\rm cTPQ}^{p}(\beta)|\Phi_{\rm cTPQ}^{p}(\beta)\rangle}.
\end{align}
%In actual calculations, 
We numerically %construct 
\red{obtain} the cTPQ state %as follows:
\red{by} 
\begin{align}
%&
\exp\Big[-\frac{\beta}{2}\mathcal{H}\Big]|\Phi_{\rm rand}^{p}\rangle=U(\Delta\tau)^{k}|\Phi_{\rm rand}^{p}\rangle,%\\
\end{align}
\red{where $\beta=k\Delta\tau$ and}
\begin{align}
%&
U(\Delta\tau)=\exp\Big[-\frac{\Delta\tau}{2}\mathcal{H}\Big]\sim\sum_{n=0}^{n_{\rm max}}\frac{1}{n!}\left(-\frac{\Delta\tau}{2}\mathcal{H}\right)^{n}\red{.} %,\\
\end{align}
%&\beta=k\Delta\tau%,

%where 
\red{In the following calculations,} we take $n_{\rm max}=6$ and $\Delta\tau =0.02$\red{, %in this paper
for which we confirm good convergence of} 
%We confirm that $n_{\rm max}=6$ ($\Delta\tau=0.02$) is sufficiently

in the calculated temperature region.
In actual calculations, we use $\mathcal{H}\Phi$~\cite{Kawamura_CPC2017,HPhi_v2,HPhi_release}, 
where the cTPQ \red{state} method is implemented.

The cTPQ \red{state} method %gives 
provides the numerically exact
results within the statistical %fluctuations

which are defined by the statistical distribution of the initial random vectors.
To %evaluate 
estimate the statistical errors %fluctuations, i.e., the errors
of the cTPQ method, 
we employ the bootstrap method~\cite{HPhi_v2}.

\red{The} classical spin at site $i$ is parameterized by $\theta_i$ and $\phi_i$ as
$\bm{S}_i = \frac{1}{2}(\sin\theta_i\cos\phi_i, \sin\theta_i\sin\phi_i, \cos\theta_i)$.
In the calculation\red{s} of the thermal average, the integral $\int \prod_i d\phi_i d\theta_i \sin\theta_i$ is evaluated %by 
using the Markov-chain Monte Carlo method.
To accelerate %the computation speed 
computations and avoid trapping %the 
spin configurations %at 
in local minima, we use the replica exchange method \cite{Hukushima1996}.
In the simulations, we prepare 48 replicas with different temperatures.
We perform 10~000~000~MC steps for measurements after 10~000~MC steps for thermalization in the 800-site cluster with %$L=10$ and $L'=40$

\red{Figure~\ref{fig:CMF_pure}(d) displays the temperature dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity divided by temperature, $\kappa_{xy}/T$. 
As this is obtained by the temperature derivative of the energy current through Eq.~\eqref{eq:def_kxy} with Eq.~\eqref{eq:JE}, let us discuss the behavior of the energy current first.

Notably, the temperature of the inflection point appears to correlate with the peak temperature of the specific heat in Fig.~\ref{fig:CMF_pure}(a).} 

%To examine the spatial distribution of the energy current,

\subsection{Effect of non-Kitaev interactions}
\label{sec:Gamma}
%As we discussed above, the thermal Hall conductivity of the pure Kitaev model shows a peak at a finite temperature, and its value largely overshoots the half-quantized value. Here, 
In this subsection, we investigate the effects of the symmetric off-diagonal interactions, the $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ terms, on the thermal Hall conductivity.
%From 
Based on the magnetic field dependence in the Kitaev model, the elementary excitations appear to be dominated by Majorana fermions rather than magnons, particularly %for 
in the weak magnetic field limit.
As we %denoted 
mentioned in Introduction, %from the 
according to the perturbative theory in the Majorana fermion representation, it is shown that
the negative $\Gamma^{\prime}$ enhances the Majorana gap~\cite{Takikawa_PRB2020}. %Hence, 
Therefore, %it is expected that
the thermal Hall conductivity is 
expected to be
enhanced by the negative $\Gamma^{\prime}$.
In contrast to $\Gamma^{\prime}$, the perturbative expansion with respect to $\Gamma$
is not straightforward, and it %is not at all clear 
remains unclear how $\Gamma$ affects the thermal Hall conductivity.
Here, we examine the %impacts 
impact of the $\Gamma'$ and $\Gamma$ %interactions 
terms in the original spin representation without assuming the Majorana excitations.

\subsubsection{Symmetric off-diagonal interaction $\Gamma^{\prime}$}
%{\bf\orange{[最初にわかりやすい摂動論の結果がある$\Gamma^{\prime}$を述べたほうがわかりやすい気がしたので、順番を入れ替えました。]}}
First, we consider the effect of the $\Gamma'$ interaction 
%to 
on $\kappa_{xy}/T$ %using 
under two representative magnetic fields %in 
along the [111] direction, 
$h=0.04$ and $h=0.08$. In Figs.~\ref{fig:all_h0.04_Gp}(a)--\ref{fig:all_h0.04_Gp}(c), 
we show several physical quantities for $-0.02\leq\Gamma'\leq0.02$. 
Here, we set %, here, 
$\Gamma = 0$ to only examine the %pure 
effects of $\Gamma'$ term. 
%Compared with $\Gamma$ terms, 
We find that $\Gamma^{\prime}$ does not significantly change 
the overall temperature dependence of the specific heat, %heights 
%are almost unchnaged by $\Gamma'$, 
%while 
although low-temperature peaks %slightly move 
shift slightly to higher (lower) temperatures %or lower temperatures 
for negative (positive) %and positive 
$\Gamma'$. %respectively. 
%Similar to the case of $\Gamma$ term, we see systematic change of the magnetization, although the observed changes are smaller than those in the case of $\Gamma$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:CMF_h0.04_ab} and \ref{fig:CMF_h0.04_ab}). Different from the $\Gamma$ term, the flux is almost unchanged by $\Gamma'$. 
We also find that the magnetization increases (decreases) monotonically for the negative (positive) $\Gamma'$.
In perturbation theory for the $\Gamma^{\prime}$ term~\cite{Takikawa_PRB2020}, it is shown that the gap is proportional to $-\Gamma^{\prime}/|K|$. This result
indicates that the effective magnetic field increases (decreases)
for the negative (positive)  $\Gamma^{\prime}$.
Therefore, the observed  $\Gamma'$ dependence of the magnetization 
is consistent with perturbation theory.

In contrast to the magnetization, 
the flux does not show considerable changes as a function of $\Gamma^{\prime}$.

Figs.~\ref{fig:all_h0.04_Gp}(d)--\ref{fig:all_h0.04_Gp}(f) show the temperature dependence of $\kappa_{xy}/T$ %with 
for the same values of $\Gamma'$. Although the effects %\red{to}

$\Gamma^{\prime}$ %largely

Such sign-dependent changes %of 
in $\kappa_{xy}$ are %somewhat 
broadly consistent with the 
results from perturbation theory \cite{TakikawaF2020}. 

We also find that $\Gamma^{\prime}$ monotonically %decreases

With increasing %$\Gamma^{\prime}$ 
from $\Gamma'=-0.02$, $\kappa_{xy}^{(L)}$ is suppressed and its peak shifts

[Fig.~\ref{fig:all_h0.04_Gp}(e)], similar to the total thermal Hall conductivity [Fig.~\ref{fig:all_h0.04_Gp}(d)].
On the other hand, $\kappa_{xy}^{(M)}$ exhibits %the 
a sign change from %the 
positive to negative [Fig.~\ref{fig:all_h0.04_Gp}(f)]. 
For $\Gamma^{\prime}\geq0.01$, 
%the two-body part $\kappa_{x}^{(M)}$ becomes negative and 
there is a competition between the positive $\kappa_{xy}^{(L)}$ and the negative $\kappa_{xy}^{(M)}$.
As a result, %in

the total $\kappa_{xy}/T$ %becomes 
turns negative around $T=0.04$, 
although its absolute value is small.

%Note that correspondence between the peak temperature and the height is different from that for the $\Gamma$ (See Figs.~\ref{fig:k_all_h0.04_G}(a) and \ref{fig:k_all_h0.08_G}(a)).
%In the case of negative $\Gamma$ we observed that the peak moves higher temperature \textit{with decreasing its height}. Such qualitative difference might be useful to compare the present model calculation to experimental observations. 

%{\bf\orange{ここはとりあえず残しています}}\blue{[カット予定？]}
%Another important feature is negative $\kappa_{xy}/T$ observed at $\Gamma' = 0.02$ with $h = 0.04$. Although it is relatively small, we observe negative values both in $\kappa_{xy}^{(L)}/T$ and $\kappa_{xy}^{(M)}/T$. \textcolor{red}{In addition, we will see similar negative $\kappa_{xy}/T$ in the classical model (Need to check the classical counterpart)}\blue{$\to$ Classicalの場合は、$\Gamma'$の方でのみ負になっています。古典系の部分では、$\Gamma'$導入の場合より$\Gamma$の方が量子性が効いていているのでは？という感じで書いていますが、ご検討お願いします}. Thus, we conclude that positive $\Gamma'$ can change the sign of $\kappa_{xy}/T$.


\subsubsection{Symmetric off-diagonal interaction $\Gamma$} 
Next, we investigate the effects of the 
$\Gamma$ term on $\kappa_{xy}/T$ under a magnetic field parallel to the $[111]$ direction. 
Again, we consider two representative magnetic fields, $h=0.04$ and $h=0.08$.

 \subsection{Classical limit}
\label{sec:classicalMC}

In this section, we show the results obtained by applying the classical approximation %for 
to Eq.~\eqref{eq:model-Hamiltonian} to compare %those 
them with those of %for 
the quantum spin model shown above.
First, we focus on the pure Kitaev model with $\Gamma=\Gamma'=0$.
Figure~\ref{fig_classical_hdep}(a) shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat of the classical Kitaev model at several magnetic fields along the $[111]$ direction.
In the absence of the magnetic field, %the 
previous studies %clarified 
have shown that the specific heat monotonically increases with decreasing temperature and approaches $3/4$ in the zero temperature limit~\cite{Sela2014,Suzuki2018_2}.
This value originates from the zero modes that are intrinsic to the pure Kitaev model without a magnetic field, and the quartic order of the spin fluctuations contributes to the specific heat at $T\to 0$.
Once the magnetic field is introduced, it lifts the zero modes, and thereby, the zero-$T$ limit of the specific heat takes the conventional value, i.e., 1, owing to the presence of the two continuous variables $(\theta,\phi)$ at each site.
We find that it shows a shoulder-like structure %a peak \orange{[peakがある？shoulder程度？]}
at the temperature corresponding to the energy scale of $h$ in the presence of the magnetic field despite the monotonic change at $h=0$.
In this temperature scale, the magnetization monotonically increases as a function of the magnetic field,
%develops, 
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_classical_hdep}(b).

\label{fig_classical_hdep}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig_classical_hdep}(c) shows the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ as a function of temperature.
When the magnetic field is not applied, 
$\kappa_{xy}$ is always zero.
By introducing the magnetic field, $\kappa_{xy}$ becomes nonzero and positive, which is consistent with the results for the quantum system.
Moreover, the temperature scale %for developing 
at which the thermal Hall conductivity 
develops
is much smaller than that for the magnetization.
The distinctly different temperature scales %appear to be 
are similar to those in the quantum system [see Fig.~\ref{fig:CMF_pure}] although the double-peak structure of the specific heat is not observed in the classical system.
In the classical result, $\kappa_{xy}$ shows a monotonic increase with decreasing temperature.
On the other hand, in the quantum system, $\kappa^{xy}/T$ %takes 
exhibits a peak around the temperature at which the specific heat exhibits the low-$T$ peak, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CMF_pure}(d). %(e).
The difference is considered to originate from an artifact in the classical system, where the macroscopic degeneracy is present in the low-energy region.
The degeneracy also causes the nonzero specific heat at zero temperature. %leading to the nonzero specific heat at zero temperature.
Thus, the quantization of $\kappa^{xy}/T$ does not occur in the classical system.
Figures~\ref{fig_classical_hdep}(d) and \ref{fig_classical_hdep}(e) present the three-body and two-body contributions of the thermal current to the thermal Hall conductivity, respectively.
The two-body %contributions 
contribution $\kappa_{xy}^{(M)}$ is much smaller than the three-body one $\kappa_{xy}^{(L)}$, indicating that the thermal Hall effect is dominated by the three-body terms of the thermal current at the edges.
This result is consistent with the quantum system, but the classical approximation appears not to reproduce small negative values of $\kappa_{xy}^{(M)}$ in weak magnetic fields as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CMF_pure}(f). %Thus, this
The difference suggests that the negative $\kappa_{xy}^{(M)}$ may be induced by
quantum effects.

Next, we discuss the field-angle dependence of physical quantities in the pure Kitaev model. We consider %the 
three field directions $[11\bar{2}]$, $[\bar{1}10]$, and $[111]$, which are perpendicular to each other.

directions.
These results indicate that the field direction hardly changes the specific heat and magnetization, which is also observed in the quantum system (see Fig.~\ref{fig:CMF_ab}). 
% \blue{[図がないので大久保さんの方で確認お願いします]}\red{（実は、appendixに置いてありました。最終的にどうするかわからないですが、とりあえずその図を参照。）}.
%On the other hand, 

In contrast to these bulk physical quantities, the thermal Hall conductivity strongly depends on the direction of the applied magnetic field.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_classical_adep004}(c), $\kappa_{xy}$ is negative and decreases with decreasing temperature for $\vec{h}\parallel [11\bar{2}]$, 
%in contrast to the case with 
whereas it is positive for
$\vec{h}\parallel [111]$.
Moreover, the absolute value for the former is smaller than that for the latter.
While %these %characteristics 
the overall %behaviors are 
behavior is consistent with that %in 
of the quantum system, the peak structure in Fig.~\ref{fig:CMF_ab}(d) is not seen in the classical case.
Furthermore, a large enhancement of $\kappa_{xy}^{(M)}$ at low temperatures for $\vec{h}\parallel [11\bar{2}]$ presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:CMF_ab}(f) is not reproduced in the classical system as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_classical_adep004}(e) despite the %similarity for the temperature 
similar temperature dependence of $\kappa_{xy}^{(L)}$ in the quantum and classical systems [Figs.~\ref{fig:CMF_ab}(e) and \ref{fig_classical_adep004}(d)].
This result suggests that the three-body term can be understood in the classical picture, but quantum fluctuations beyond the classical approach substantially contribute to the two-body term.
% \red{[2体項はtime-reversal evenで、磁場によって古典的に誘発されたものではないから？？]}
% \red{[以下は、量子系のところに入れた方が良いかも]}
We also find that the thermal Hall conductivity is zero in the magnetic field applied along the $[\bar{1}10]$ direction, which is %results in 
a consequence of the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, as discussed before.
% This is understood from the fact that the Hamiltonian is invariant under the following two operations simultaneously:
% The $C_2$ rotation along the $[\bar{1}10]$ axis in the spin space transferring $(S^x,S^y,S^z)$ to $(-S^y,-S^x,-S^z)$ and the rotation of the honeycomb plane along the $z$~bond in the real space, which exchanges the $x$ and $y$~bonds.
% However, the rotation of the honeycomb plane inverts the component along the zigzag edge of the position vector $\bm{r}$, and thereby, the thermal current along the zigzag edge should be zero.
% Note that the above argument is applicable in the presence of the $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ interactions.

%For the thermal transport, 
Regarding thermal transport,
we find that the negative (positive) $\Gamma'$ enhances (suppresses) the thermal Hall conductivity [Fig.~\ref{fig_classical_gpdep004}(c)]. We note that $\kappa_{xy}$ becomes

Moreover, in this temperature range, $\kappa_{xy}^{(M)}$ is much smaller than $\kappa_{xy}^{(L)}$, as shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:all_h0.04_Gp}(e) and \ref{fig:all_h0.04_Gp}(f).

These results indicate that $\kappa_{xy}$ in the classical systems corresponds to %that

In Fig.~\ref{fig:cmap_classical}, we show the color plot of $\kappa_{xy}$ in the $h$-$T$ plane of the classical model. 
We can see that $\Gamma$ term do not affects the overall behavior of $\kappa_{xy}$, 
while negative (positive) $\Gamma^{\prime}$ enhance (diminish) $\kappa_{xy}$.
The insensitivity to the Γ term is in contrast to the results for quantum systems.
Thus, the effects of $\Gamma$ term are governed by the
quantum effects while those of $\Gamma^{\prime}$ can be captured by the
classical model.

This result indicates that the large thermal Hall conductivity observed in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ experiments 
can be %explained by the physics 
understood within the framework of the Kitaev model. 
We have demonstrated that the field-angle dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity remains consistent with the sign of the Chern number 
of Majorana fermions even in the high-magnetic-field regime.

the enhancement is governed by the two-body part $\kappa_{xy}^{(M)}$.

whereas the effect of the $\Gamma$ term is not.
In other words, the behavior of the three-body part $\kappa_{xy}^{(L)}$

This result suggests that the $\Gamma$ term %has a larger

Another important issue is the comparison %with 
between our results and the thermal Hall conductivity induced by topological magnons \cite{McClarty_PRB2018, Joshi_PRB2018, ChernZK2021}.

Another %possibility is

In contrast, in our calculation, we explicitly consider open boundaries and the thermal Hall conductivity is calculated %through 
based on the energy current at the edges. If the sign difference %in the sign really comes

Our findings %highlight 
demonstrate the importance of developing methods that do not rely on specific quasiparticle assumptions. Most previous theoretical studies on the thermal Hall conductivity have focused on analyzing the contributions from the specific quasiparticles, such as the Majorana fermions and the topological magenons. In contrast, the method developed in this study enables the calculation of the thermal Hall conductivity in quantum spin systems without assuming specific quasiparticles. This approach provides a theoretical foundation for understanding experimental results, where the contributions from multiple quasiparticles may coexist. Given that thermal Hall conductivity measurements have been performed on a wide range of strongly correlated materials, our method offers a fundamental theoretical framework for their interpretation and serves as a useful tool for identifying exotic quasiparticles from experimental observations. This work paves the way for a more comprehensive understanding of the thermal Hall effect in strongly correlated materials.

\section{Benchmark on tensor network method}
\label{app:XTRG_Bench}
In this Appendix, we present several benchmark %calculations 
results for the XTRG method. 
First, we show %bond-dimension 
dependence of the several representative 
physical quantities on bond dimension $D$ %of 
for the pure Kitaev model on the $(L, L') = (6, 6)$ cylinder 
%for bond-dimensions $D=300$, $400$, and $D=500$ 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:CMk_XC6}. 
%We showed the data for $D=500$. 
We find that %$D$ dependence 
the dependence on $D$ becomes larger %for $T \lesssim 0.05$
for the specific heat and the thermal Hall conductivity %in
at $h=0.04$ when $T \lesssim 0.05$.
However, %in 
for $D=500$, 
clear peak structures appear in the specific heat and the thermal Hall conductivity %in $D=500$ 
and their values %are not so deviated 
deviate from those %of 
at $D=400$. 
Thus, we conclude %consider 
that %the 
$D=500$ is sufficiently large to %discuss 
analyze the thermal Hall conductivity %and related physics 
for $(L, L') = (6, 6)$, $T\geq 0.01$, and $h\geq 0.04$.

Next, for %another 
a different system size $(L, L') = (8, 4)$, 
we examine the bond-dimension dependence of the physical quantities.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CMk_XC4}, 
for $D$ up to $400$, we obtained almost converged data even for the specific heat and the thermal Hall conductivity at $h=0.04$. 
Although the accuracy of the matrix product representation depends on the circumference, i.e., the system size, we can obtain %the almost 
nearly converged results
for $D=400$. These results demonstrate that the XTRG method with a sufficiently large bond dimension
$D$ is a powerful tool for investigating the finite-temperature properties of quantum spin systems.

\section{Benchmark on thermal pure quantum state}
\label{app:cTPQ}
%\orange{{\bf この節はそもそもいらない気がしますが...}$\to$とりあえず、情報はあっても良いと思ったので、残しています}
In this Appendix, we examine the accuracy of the cTPQ method %in this section
by comparing %the results of the cTPQ method 
its results with those of
%the 
full diagonalization for a small $(L, L') = (2, 4)$ cluster (the total system size is $N_{\rm s}=16$).
In the full exact diagonalization (ED) method, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian, whose dimension is
$2^{16}=65536$ using ScaLAPACK~\cite{scalapack}. 
Using the obtained eigenvalues and eigenvectors,
we calculate the temperature dependence of %the 
physical quantities.

At $h=0.04$, the specific heat $C$ exhibits a three-peak structure in this system size.
This structure may be an artifact of the small system size 
since it %vanishes 
disappears %for 
in larger system sizes.
Even at $h=0.08$, %the 
a hump in the specific heat %still exists 
remains around $T=0.02$.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{comp_ED}(a),
the cTPQ method reproduces the temperature dependence 
of the specific heat for $h=0.04$ and $h=0.08$, including
its three-peak structure.
Figure~\ref{comp_ED}(b) shows the temperature dependence of the magnetization.
The cTPQ method also reproduces the results of full exact diagonalization.

We show the temperature dependence of the thermal 
Hall conductivity $\kappa$ in Fig.~\ref{comp_ED}(c).
The thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa$ at $|h|=0.04$
becomes negative for $T\leq 0.01$. This negative $\kappa$ may also %be

result form finite-size effects, possibly due to the short length of the edges.
In fact, $\kappa$ becomes positive for larger system sizes, as we %show 
demonstrated above.
The cTPQ method %well reproduces this peculiar temperature dependence.

At $h=0.08$, $\kappa$ shows 
a single peak, %and it is also well

\section{Comparison between tensor network method and thermal pure quantum state}
\label{app:XTRGcTPQ}
In this Appendix, we examine the accuracy of the XTRG method
by comparing the results of the cTPQ method with those of the XTRG
for the $(L, L') = (6, 2)$ cluster ($N_{\rm s}=24$). 
Figure~\ref{comp_XTRG}(a) shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat. 
We find that both methods reproduce the two-peak structure in the specific heat, which is a 
characteristic feature %in 
of the Kitaev model. 
%Except for the 
Apart from a small discrepancy %around 
near the low-temperature peak 
at $h=0.04$, both methods %agree well with each other

%over the three magnitudes of the temperature scale.
This consistency demonstrates that the XTRG method, with a sufficiently large 
bond dimension, 
%gives 
provides accurate results.

In Fig.~\ref{comp_XTRG}(b),
we show the temperature dependence of the magnetization.
%In 
Across all the temperature regions, 
we find that both methods %agree well 
show good agreement within the error bars.
Since the magnetization is given by the first derivative of the
free energy, its fluctuations are expected to be small.
This may %be the reason 
explain why the error bars of the magnetization
are smaller than those of the specific heat and the thermal Hall conductivity.

We show the temperature dependence of $\kappa$
in Fig.~\ref{comp_XTRG}(c) and find that
$D=500$ already %gives

results of the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa$ except for the small deviations %on

These results indicate that

presented in this paper %correctly 
accurately capture the %essence

extended Kitaev models.
